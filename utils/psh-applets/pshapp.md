# (psh) pshapp

The interactive session of Phoenix SHell is itself an applet called `pshapp` **and is accessible using `psh`** command. It delivers a commandline user interface together with command interpreter.

For thorough documentation please refer to [psh documentation](../psh.md), as `pshapp` is only a form of nesting the commandline utility in `psh`.
